# test data for tsv input, hierarchy scoring

# experimental data input should be a tsv file with 5 columns

# ID: id of the experiment
# e.g. 1

# SCORE: The model will get this score if it agrees with all the experiments in the
#        higher hierarchy.
# e.g. 1.0

# INTERVENTION: The nodes, and the values (0 or 1)
# e.g. A=1,B=0,C=0

# NODE - the observed node
# e.g. Closure

# VALUE - one of OFF, OFF/Some, Some, Some/ON, ON
# e.g. Some/ON
