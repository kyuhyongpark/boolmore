demo on Cortical Area Development (CAD) model

## Example

```
cd boolmore/demo
python run.py
```

parameters are adjusted for the small model of size 5
mutation probability: 0.2 (compared to 0.01 for benchmarks)
models per iteration: 10 (compared to 100 for benchmarks)
models to keep per iteration: 2 (compared to 20 for benchmarks)

the log will be stored as "demo_log.txt"
the final model will be stored as "demo_id_gen.bnet"
