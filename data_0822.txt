# experimental data input
#
# score: The model will get this score if it agrees with all the results below
# e.g. [1.0]
#
# Interventions: The nodes, and the values (0 or 1) separated by tab
# e.g. [ABA	0	CPK3_21	0]
#
# Outcome: A single node, and the expected value separated by tab
# The outcome value can be 0 or 0.5 or 1, and multiple values can be listed
# If multiple values for outcome are listed,
# the model will be checked whether it matches with one of them.
# e.g. [Closure	0	0.5]
# the model is considered to agree with this result if it gets 0 or 0.5
# 
# If multiple intervention/outcome pairs are listed,
# the model should agree with all to get the score.
