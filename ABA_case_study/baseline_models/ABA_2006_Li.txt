# Changed node names to correspond with 2017 ABA model
# added rule for ABA explicitely
# deleted Arg which was a source that does not regulate any other node
# assigned constant values to nodes that were originally source nodes: ABH1, AGB1, ERA1

# score:  129.75 / 248 (52.3%)
# complexity: 87
# default_sources: {'ABA': 0}
