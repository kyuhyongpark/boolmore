# Benchmarks

## Description

`validation` directory contains the main benchmarks for `boolmore`. Here we show that the models trained with the training set can have high accuracy for the validation set. 40 models from the Cell Collective are used.

`hierarchy` directory contains benchmark comparison between hierarchy scoring and non-hierarchy scoring. We use 8 sampled models for this benchmark.

`optimization` directory contains results of multiple runs with different parameter values. We used 8 sampled models and the ABA model for this benchmark.

`comparison` directory contains benchmark comparison with `BoNesis` and `Gitsbe`, on the ABA model.
